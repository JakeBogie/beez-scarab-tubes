# Adapting First Spear Tubes to a Velocity Systems Scarab LT / LE

It all started with getting really sick and tired of constantly tearing off a placard worth of velcro just to get in and out of my Scarab. Searching the internet found many piece-it-together solutions for adapting First Spear Tubes to the Scarab, yet nothing would incorporate an elastic cummerbund.

Having just purchased an additional Scarab LT (lightly used) and looking to solve this problem for both plate carriers, I ended up finding Beez Combat Systems. It started with an email, which led to a phone call, which in the end, ended up with a 'prototype' based on a discussion.

Consider this a quick install guide.

**What you will need:**

1. Velocity Systems Scarab LT or LE
2. Beez Combat Systems AR 3 Finger Elastic Tubes Kit

You'll see in the guide ahead that the Beez AR 3 Finger Elastic Tubes Kit that I am using is a 2 Cell cummerbund. I'm a skinny man that spends way too much time doing cardio and hiking. I'll work over this coming winter to upgrade to a 3 Cell cummerbund.
