# Adapting First Spear Tubes to a Velocity Systems Scarab LT / LE

It all started with getting really sick and tired of constantly tearing off a placard worth of velcro just to get in and out of my Scarab. Searching the internet found many piece-it-together solutions for adapting First Spear Tubes to the Scarab, yet nothing would incorporate an elastic cummerbund.

Having just purchased an additional Scarab LT (lightly used) and looking to solve this problem for both plate carriers, I ended up finding Beez Combat Systems. It started with an email, which led to a phone call, which in the end, ended up with a 'prototype' based on a discussion.

Consider this a quick install guide.

**What you will need:**

Velocity Systems Scarab LT or LE
Beez Combat Systems AR 3 Finger Elastic Tubes Kit

You'll see in the guide ahead that the Beez AR 3 Finger Elastic Tubes Kit that I am using is a 2 Cell cummerbund. I'm a skinny man that spends way too much time doing cardio and hiking. I'll work over this coming winter to upgrade to a 3 Cell cummerbund.

## Install Guide

### Step 1 - Remove the old cummerbund

This step is pretty self-explanatory, open up the plate pocket, remove your plate, and remove the plate retainer strap. Set the plate retainer strap aside for later as you will want to put it back in.

### Step 2 - Layout your work

In the following two images, I’m showing how the fingers and the anchor point interface with one another along with the shock cord. This image is just a mock-up of what you will be doing inside of the plate pocket. A pencil is a handy tool for lacing the shock cord through the laser cut anchor point and writing a letter to your Mom; she deserves to hear from you (even if you do still live in her basement.)

### Step 3 - Install and lace-up in the plate pocket

In the following image, I have inserted the cummerbund fingers into the plate pocket, placed the anchor point on the internal velcro, and used a pencil to lift the holes to make it easier to weave the shock cord.

I’ve finished the lacing of the shock cord and tied off the two pieces with a square not, and stowed the excess shock cord in the finger loops. Don’t trim the shock cord too short, as it’s always good to have some spare shock cord if you need it.

### Step 4 - Reinstall plate retainer strap

Now I’ve placed the plate retainer strap over the anchor point, and it’s time to get the plate back in the plate pocket.
